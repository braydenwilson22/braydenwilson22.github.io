                Hello! I am <strong>Brayden Wilson</strong>, a student currently enrolled in ENGL 170. 
                This blog serves as a digital portfolio for my work throughout the semester, 
                exploring the intersections of literature, rhetoric, and modern composition.
            </p>

                interests, or what you hope to achieve in this course. For example: "Outside of 
                ENGL 170, I am passionate about photography and digital media, and I hope to 
                apply the critical thinking skills I learn here to my future career in communications."]
