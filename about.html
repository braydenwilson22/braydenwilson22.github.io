        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my blog for ENGL 170! My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a student at Lindenwood University.</p>
        
        <p>This semester, I'll be using this space to explore the intersection of AI, writing, and intellectual work. Through three posts a week, I'll be engaging with course materials, responding to my classmates' ideas, and reflecting on how generative AI is changing the way we think and create.</p>
        
        <p>Check back often for updates as we dive deeper into the world of digital composition and "building little worlds."</p>
